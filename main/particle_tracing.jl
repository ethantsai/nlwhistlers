# functions for particle tracing are found here




# generic particle tracing w/ dphi and dlambda
# dphi determines wave packet sizes
# dlambda determines an exponential decay
# of wave power as function of latitude
# simulation as used for jgr_2022 work



# particle tracing using modified B_w from Agapitov+2018
# this simulation used for jgr_2023




# particle tracing using modified frequency from Agapitov+2018




# particle tracing including three different WNA models
